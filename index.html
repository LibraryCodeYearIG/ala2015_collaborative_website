<h2>About the Class</h2>
<p>In this hackathon attendees will learn to use the Bootstrap front-end framework and the Git version control system to create, modify and share code for a new library website. Expect a friendly atmosphere and a creative hands-on experience that will introduce you to web literacy for the 21st century librarian. Morning will consist of in-depth introductions to the tools, while afternoon will see participants split into working groups to build a single collaborative library website.</p>

<!--Bootstrap Info here-->
<h3>What is Bootstrap?</h3>

<p><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> is an open-source, responsive designed, and front-end web framework that can be used to create complete website redesigns to rapid prototyping. It is useful for many library web applications, such as customizing LibGuides (version 2) or creating responsive sites. This workshop will give attendees a crash-course into the basics of what Bootstrap can do and how to code it. Attendees can work individually or in teams.</p>

<h3>What is git?</h3>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is an open-source software tool that allows you to manage drafts and collaboratively work on projects - whether you’re building a library app, writing a paper, or organizing a talk. We will also talk about <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, a massively popular website which hosts git projects and has built-in features like issue tracking and simple web page hosting - such as this page for our class. </p>
