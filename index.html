<h2>About the Class</h2>
<p>In this hackathon attendees will learn to use the Bootstrap front-end framework and the Git version control system to create, modify and share code for a new library website. Expect a friendly atmosphere and a creative hands-on experience that will introduce you to web literacy for the 21st century librarian. Morning will consist of in-depth introductions to the tools, while afternoon will see participants split into working groups to build a single collaborative library website.</p>

<h3>What is git and why would I want to I learn it?</h3>
<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is an open-source software tool that allows you to manage drafts and collaboratively work on projects - whether you’re building a library app, writing a paper, or organizing a talk. We will also talk about <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>, a massively popular website which hosts git projects and has built-in features like issue tracking and simple web page hosting - such as this page for our class. </p>
